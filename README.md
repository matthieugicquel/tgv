# TGV - an experimental faster bundler and dev server for React Native, built on top of esbuild

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is experimental, you probably don't want to use it for anything serious right now**

Known limitations:

- You'll need a recent React Native version
- The compatibility between esbuild's output and React Native's JS runtimes is not clear yet, some JS features may break everything
- Some very useful features like stack trace symbolication are not yet implemented

# Goals

- A dev server that runs all day long without getting in your way. It should handle things like branch switches, `yarn install` smoothly and you should never wait for it
- Fast bundling (a few seconds) so that JS deploys (codepush, expo...) are fast
- Smaller and faster prod bundles thanks to tree-shaking and ES modules scope-hoisting

# Installation

Node >= 16 is required.

This package is not yet published to npm.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:matthieugicquel/tgv.git
cd tgv
yarn
yarn link

cd <the RN repo you want to test it with>
```

Add to package.json:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "tgv": "file:<path-to-tgv>"
}
```

Add `.tgv-cache` to `.gitignore`


```sh
cd <the RN repo you want to test it with>

yarn link tgv
yarn
```

Then add to react-native.config.js: (or create it)

```js
/**
 * See type definition for full config options
 * @type {import('tgv/config').TGVConfigDef}
 */
const tgvConfig = {
  transformPackages: {
    flow: [],
  }
};

module.exports = {
  commands: require('tgv/commands')(tgvConfig),
  // other react-native config options
};

```

# Usage

## Dev server
```sh
# This starts a dev server that replaces metro, do it before `run-x` so that metro doesn't start automatically
yarn react-native tgv-start

yarn react-native run-(ios|android)
```

## Using as the production bundler

### üçè iOS

Add `export BUNDLE_COMMAND=tgv-bundle` to the "Bundle react native code and images" script in Xcode for the app target:

]
```
